# OSA-Migo-Mk5
Latest Migo redesigned to be a true micro fighter, under 300 tons and made of low tech parts and accessible Eos mats.

Made for starter pilots and infantry looking to weigh in on fleet fights, this swarm fighter can be made by almost anyone with small tech investment in large numbers, can be used as a scout ship, small ship escort or as a assult ship for infantry to land on sieged stations or cap ships.

//Specs//

2 mounted weapons, 2 autogun with a basic trigger and saftey system.

Shoot_1+ is your trigger, bind this to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located on the top rear of the ship, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured lightly using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.
Materials and components are low tech, i leave it to the user to increase cost to your tastes.

289543.656 kg in weight, 148ms at 60fps.

1 small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 1 hour 40 mins estimated flight time.

1 T1 fuel chamber, 1 T1 generator, 2 T1 enhancers 2 hour 40 mins estimated fight time, 8 hours 30 mins flight time.

Basic script for current Fuel/Prop times.

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, Roll_L and Roll_R are your keybinds for roll.

Entry is through a small gap from the side of the ship.

//Design//

Redesigned to address issues I had with the Mk5, the latest Migo cuts some of the more experemental design choices in favour of a more reliable weapon configuation and a "Mouse Fighter" shape and weight.

The OG Collective Mouse was always an inspirations for the Migo, being one of the first popular micro fighters, but i never copied the single clam shell wedge shape for a variety of reasons, but this resulted in inadiquete vision for the pilot in most Migo designs, thus the Mk6 takes the hull of the previous varient, drops one of its clam shell plates and 2 autoguns and has been remoddeled into a wedge to provide the pilot better vision.

Small ammounts of voxel armour have been used to supplement the large clam plate on its front face, providing some protection to the pilot and components, allowing it to survive glancing salvos in fights, and provide decent protection againt infantry grade weapons.

Armour is made of Char with an Aegisisum big plate clam shell.

6 tri thrusters propel the ship, all angled inward slightly to minimize the size of the thruster trail, helping slip under other players attention.

Low tech T1 components and Eos mats make this fighter readily available to any and all, most of the time, made to be one of the quickest ways to arm every player before or during a siege.

//Tactics//

Low cost means faster production and ease of access, allowing anyone to field entire armadas of micros to overwhelm there opponents.

While not as valuable now in the games current state, a higher pop and siege gameplay will boost the value of a cost effective micro for general use by waring factions.

Usable for assaulting infantry as a attack ship, light but armed scout ship, point defence ship for quick response to piracy and as a pirate ship itself.

Due to the potential emergent nature of PvP in starbase, there will always be a need for ultra light cheap base fighter to utilise in all situations, holes in your fleet composition can always be shored up with numbers and easy of access micro fighters.

Starting combat pilots or part time PvPers can arm themself's very quickly even from Eos, and can be flown with zero fear of failing, this is by far the best way to gain confidence needed to fly bigger and more expensive fighters, there is only up from this point, any armour stripped from a enemy, sneaky thruster damage to assists a friendly, endo kills on grounded infantry and lucky cockpit snipes are victory's for little to any risk or expense.
