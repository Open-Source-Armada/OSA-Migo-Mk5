# OSA-Migo-Mk5
Latest Migo redesigned to be a true micro fighter, under 400 tons and made of accessible Eos mats.

This new model of the Migo has returned to its roots, using 2 copies of the largest plate, then form fitting the ships internals into these plates for a compact, high HP micro fighter.

It is also overgunned with 4 autos to give it a chance of delivering a fatal hit, and to overpower other ultra light fighters.

Micro fighters generaly can not circle fight with the majority of ships, so the Mk5 utilises a more jousty, evasive stratagy to make use of the ships high speed and small size.

Perfect ship for infantry bombadment, swarm tactics and a intro ship for pilots starting out.

Included is a experimental missile varient, armed with 20 missiles tuned to be as safe to fire as i can, use at your own risk ;)

//Specs//

4 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located in the cockpit, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus and CenterSenseMinus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust both to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus and MinSenseMinus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus and MaxSenseMinus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating.

Materials and components are on the low end, Incredibly cheap, still recomended to craft the guns to fully lowere the print cost.

Comes in 4 auto/4 auto 4 missile launchers.

357877.469 kg in weight, 145ms at 60fps.

1 small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 1 hour 40 mins estimated flight time.

1 T1 fuel chamber, 1 T1 generator, 3 T1 enhancers 2 hour 40 mins estimated fight time.

Basic script for current Fuel/Prop times.

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, Roll_L and Roll_R are your keybinds for roll.

Entry is through a small gap from the front of the ship.

//Design//

The original Migo Mk1 was my first attempt at making a PvP ship in starbase, usilising the large clam shell plates to house almost the entire ship and pilot.

This gave it fantastic base HP for a small size, and allowed me to take on larger ships and gain practice fighting for a very low cost.

After building a Mk4 that was too big and expensive to meet my criteria of a micro fighter, i retuned to this same design that started it all.

The Mk5 is 150 tons lighter than the Mk1 and Mk3, and uses no materials or alloys that can not be aquired in the Eos belt.

Almost the entire ship is contained within two copies of the largest plate in game, providing high protection in all directions, supplementry plates cover the remaining areas.

Meta armour techniques have been used only around the guns and pilot to minimize weight, cost and size.

Central cockpit grants direct vision for easier shooting, cockpit snipes are not as much of a factor due to the incredibly small size of the ship.

Thrusters have been angled 5 degrees inward to minimise trail visability, makes the ship harder to track during fights, and makes the ship hard to spot when following other vessels.

The missile varient takes advantage of the cheap and disposible nature of the Mk5 to test field the new 5 missile launcher, right now they are too janky to be utilised, but still very fun.

//Tactics//

Low cost means faster production and ease of access, allowing anyone to field entire armardas of micros to overwelm there opponents.

While not as valuble now in the games current state, a higher pop and siege gameplay will boost the value of a cost effective micro for general use by waring factions.

Usable for assulting infantry as a attack ship, light but armed scout ship, point defence ship for quick responce to piracy and as a pirate ship itself.

Due to the potential emergent nature of PvP in starbase, there will always be a need for ultra light cheap base fighter to utilise in all situations, holes in your fleet compisition can always be shored up with numbers and easy to access micro fighters.

Starting combat pilots or part time PvPers can arm themsefls very quickly even from Eos, and can be flown with zero fear of failing, this is by far the best way to gain confidence needed to fly bigger and more expensive fighters, there is only up from this point, any armour stripped from a enemy, sneaky thruster damage to assists a friendly, endo kills on grounded infantry and lucky cockpit snipes are victorys for little to any risk or expense.
